# tf-specialization
This repository implements deep neural networks using TensorFlow on some cool datasets. The material is taken from the [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) but is implemented in python - as opposed to the Jupyter Notebook - for production-level adoption.  


## Installation
On you machine, navigate to the directory you would like to clone the project to. Clone the project using the following git bash command:
```
git clone https://github.com/connected-ftarlan/tf-specialization
```

## Dependencies
You can install all the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file provided. In short, you need a reasonable version of the following libraries:
- python 3.6.x
- numpy
- tensorflow
- matplotlib (only needed for visualization purposes)
- pillow
- scipy

The exact versions of each of these libraries is included in the `requirements.txt` file. 
To install the dependencies, create and activate a virtual environment; then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
